1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,678
The criterion we will talk about is 2.4.4

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,000
that is, the purpose of the link.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,900
Today we will first talk about understanding the criterion

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,700
that is, we try to understand

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,700
the purpose of this criterion and the advantages.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,700
Then we talk about the techniques, that is, how to apply the criterion.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,700
And lastly we talk about the code

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,660
that is, we understand the criterion programmatically.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's try to understand it better.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,700
This criterion is for help
Let's try to understand it better.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,000
This criterion is for help

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,700
the user to understand the purpose of each link

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,700
that is, to make them understand which links

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,700
they have to follow, especially to make them understand the page.

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,000
If we have several links on one page

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,900
or a list of links

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,360
obviously it must be clear what they are for.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,700
Let's take an example of applying the criterion.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,500
For example, if we have a list of book formats

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,800
that is, HTML, PDF and MP3

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,800
and we put

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,800
in the text of the link of all formats the title of the book,

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,800
a screen-reader user would be in difficulty

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,990
in fact the format would not be very explicit.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,800
So, in the first link we can put the title of the book

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,800
in the second and third we could put the other formats,

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,900
in this case PDF and MP3.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,900
With this criterion we obviously have advantages

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,200
for people with disabilities.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,200
In fact people,for example, with visual impairments

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,900
will be able to determine the purpose of the link

32
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,770
thanks to the various textual alternatives compatible with the screen-reader.

33
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,970
Or people with cognitive limitations will not be confused

34
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,570
by multiple navigation methods

35
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,570
and content that is difficult to understand.

36
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,270
We also think of who have movement problems

37
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,570
They will avoid keystrokes to return to the home page

38
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,000
because they were wrong to click on a link.

39
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,570
The first technique we can find is the G91

40
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,100
that is, provide a link text

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,570
which describes the purpose of it.

42
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,670
It is indicated with the use of the tag a and the attribute href.

43
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,870
Let's see an example.

44
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,890
Problem: if I insert a link the user doesn't know if

45
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,890
click it yes or no, he doesn't know the purpose.

46
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,890
What is the solution?

47
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,890
Use a tag a, which allows you to insert a link

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,890
and a text that clarifies the purpose.

49
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,890
Let's look at "more information".

50
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:19,290
In addition to the code, we can find

51
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,290
the "To check that the technique is used". What do we have to do?

52
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,520
Verify that the link text describes the purpose of the link.

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,900
Let us remember that our goal is to clarify the purpose

54
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,900
Let's see the example!

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,900
Here we have a clickable link.

56
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,900
As you can see there is a text that describes what it does, so if we click on it

57
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:55,900
obviously the page that interests us and the user wanted to click will open.

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,900
We can see the same example without the criterion.

59
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,900
As we note, without a clear text that clarifies the purpose

60
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,900
the user don't know if he wants to click it or not.

61
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,250
The second technique is G53, that is, to identify the purpose

62
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,660
of the link by using the link text combined

63
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:29,000
to an attached sentence, that is, before the link we explain essentially

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,800
with a small description what it is used for.

65
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,800
Let's see better.

66
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,700
What's the problem? If I insert a link the user does not know if click it

67
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
yes or no, he doesn't know the purpose!

68
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,500
Solution: use "a" tag that allows you to insert a link

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,000
but before it enter a small description.

70
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,700
Let's see "more information"!

71
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,930
So, to check that the technique is used you have to

72
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,500
-Check that the link is part of a sentence

73
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,450
-Check that the link text combined with

74
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,860
the text of the sentence that encloses it, describes the purpose.
